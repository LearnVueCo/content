Not only do these help save time, but they come with

- Built in components for common uses cases

Vue Black Dashboard Pro is a Bootstrap 4 Admin Dashboard that comes with dozens of components, custom elements, plugins, and example code that will be suited to perfectly match your design needs.

In my opinion, the default color schemes are really aesthetic and give your application a certain level of professionalism and polish.

One of the things that I love about this dashboard is that it comes with both a dark mode and a light mode. This toggleable feature really adds that extra layer of customization that can make an application stand out.
